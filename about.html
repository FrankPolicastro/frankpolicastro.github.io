      Throughout the course of any mediation process, different documents and financial ledgers are produced to help facilitate discussions to help reach an agreement that is satisfactory for all parties involved.  It is difficult to agree on a baseline, and troublesome to advance discussions without some sort of benchmarking capability.  I've discovered that the difficulties of this process can be alleviated with the aid of visualizations that can help in asset identification (in divorce proceedings) and large transaction analysis (Educational expenses between annulled marriages).

      I've recently complimented my data analysis background with a discipline in Data Visualization, and it's my wish to help participants in mediation settlement  (mediator, defendant, plaintiff or anyone in decision-based discussions) create visualizations that help to benchmark initial discussion points as well as visualizations that create outcomes that are fare and equitable to all parties involved.
